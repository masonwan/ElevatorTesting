 * Description - 
	 * This elevator algorithm selects the least recently used car, when a request is made.
	 * Once a car services a request, it is moved to the end of the queue. 
	 * For the next request, the car now at the top of the queue is used to service the request. 
	 * This way, all the cars would be used equally. But, since this algorithm does not take into consideration 
	 * the closest car, it could lead to delays in processing the request.
